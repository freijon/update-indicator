I never really was satisfied with the update management and that the update-manager just pops up without any indication. So i made this little application which integrates in the application menu and notifies the user about updates.

To build the vala sources, you will need the following dependencies:

- libgtk2.0-dev
- libgconf2-dev
- libappindicator3-dev
- libnotify-dev
- libglib2.0-dev
- libvala-0.1x-dev
- valac

Just run the usual:

./configure
make
make install

You can use the "--with-preferences" option to run the preferences on start.

Since I do not have the knowledge yet to create makefiles, you will have to move the icons and ui manually. Just copy the folders "icons" and "ui" as delivered to "/usr/share/indicator-updatemanager"
